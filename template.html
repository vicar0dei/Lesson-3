            <p>Hello, my name is Joseph Brown, and I am excited to be taking this course. Even though we started off on rocky footing, what with you not responding when I had some technical difficulties getting to this assignment, I will assume that you merely meant to do this as a basic knowledge test. I used to do web development when I was in my early teens, and when I saw a Web Dev course I was excited to see what I could learn. I am hoping to pass this class and move on in my Associate's degree, using it to progress my Walmart management career.<br>
            Something that I am most excited about in this course is learning all of the new and interesting technologies surrounding web development. Back when I learned, it was just clacking away in Visual Studio Basic and hoping that everything turned out alright, because my teacher had as much of an idea of what was wrong as I did. Now I can type out a sentence, and a fancy bot will try and fail to guess at my sentence structure the entire time. The future is now! Jokes aside, this is all a very exciting expereience for me, and I hope to have some fun in this course.<br>
