# Lesson 3 Project
At the end of each lesson, you will be completing a project that includes developing web pages using the concepts and skills covered throughout the lesson. Before you start the project, make sure that you have completed all How-To and Practice Activities within the lesson, which will greatly help you with this project.

In this project, you will use what you have learned so far to create a basic web page introducing: you! We would love to learn about your educational goals, including what degree or certificate you may be taking the course for.

## Project Prep
If you're reading this, you have successfully accepted the assignment invitation and cloned it to your computer. (Good job!) 

> If you need a refresher on any steps related to Accepting invitations and cloning your repo, refer to the [How To: Clone and Open a Repo](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis-public/git-github-and-vs-code/working-on-activities-and-assignments#How-To-Clone-and-Open-a-Repo) tutorial.

1. If you haven't done so already, clone the repo to your computer.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there. 
   
   > **TIP:** It is recommended that you view the `README.md` file in **Preview Mode** using **Split View**. You can use the Split View feature (under the **View** menu, **Editor Layout** options) in VS Code to display the `Readme.md` file on one side of VS Code and the files you need to edit on the other side. You can also open the `Readme.md` file in Preview mode by right clicking on the file and selecting the **Open Preview** option.

3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions.

   > **TIP:** Before beginning any work on the project, read through all the steps to understand what you will be doing.


## Create A Basic Web Page

1. Create a new blank HTML5 document. If you are using VS Code, click the **New File** button in the Explorer pane next to the name of the assignment.
0. Save the file as **template.html**. The file will be saved in the default user directory for GitHub. For example, on a Windows computer it should be saved to c:/users/JaneDoe/github-classroom/rsc-cis133DA-in-v12/projectRepo. **NOTE** The file will be saved into the folder for the specific project repo you are working on. Do not save the file to a different folder. If you do that, the file will not sync to your GitHub account when you Sync and Commit your work. 
0. Using the appropriate tags, create **the four basic HTML elements**.
0. Insert **a multi-line HTML comment** within the head element of the web page with the following information: Course, Section, and Lesson Number and fill in the information for your course and lesson. For example: 
   > Course: CIS133DA<br>Section: 99999<br>Lesson: 3

0. Give the **page a title** of: {Your MEID} - Template. Replace the {Your MEID} with your actual MEID, like the following example:
   > ABC1234567 - Template
0. **Save** your web page. **Sync** your file to GitHub and apply a **Commit** that says: `Created template with basic HTML elements`. If you need a refresher on how to Sync and Apply a commit, refer to [How to Apply a Commit and Sync your Files to GitHub](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis-public/git-github-and-vs-code/working-on-activities-and-assignments)
0. Using the appropriate tags, add the following content to your web page:
   
   - Create a **first-level heading** with the following text: Basic Template
   - Create a **paragraph** under this heading with dummy text (see <a title="Working with Paragraphs" href="https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis133da-in-v12/lesson-3-introduction-html/working-with-paragraphs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working with Paragraphs</a>) as the text within the paragraph. 
   - Create a **second-level heading** with your first and last name as the text.
   - **Add at least one paragraph** under this second-level heading with a brief intro about yourself so your instructor can get to know you a bit more. You can include details about your educational goals, what you hope to get out of the course, etc. 
   - Create **another paragraph** after your bio paragraph(s) with general contact information with each contact method **on a separate line** within a single paragraph. Include:
      - The text "Phone:" along with a fake phone number.
      - The text "Email:" along with your student email address.
0. Create **another paragraph** for the page copyright info. For the text use the following format: 
   > Copyright {YEAR} by {Your Full Name}
0. **Save** your web page. **Sync** your file to GitHub and apply a **Commit** that says: `Added Content`.

## Submit the Project
Once you have completed your project, you need to let your instructor know that it is ready to be graded. This is done by submitting the Repo URL to the assignment in RioLearn.

   > **TIP:** If you need a refresher on how to submit your work, view: [Submitting Assignments & Viewing Feedback](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis-public/git-github-and-vs-code/submitting-assignments-and-viewing-feedback).
1. Review your work and make any necessary updates. **Save** the file. You can either select **FILE>SAVE** or use the keyboard shortcut **CTRL+S**.
2. **Sync** the changes (if changes were made) and apply a final **Commit** that says: `Completed final review and updates before submission`.
3. Verify that all files appear on GitHub.

   > **TIP:** You can view any of your repos by going to the GitHub organization for the course - [RSC-CIS133DA-IN-V12 Organization](https://github.com/rsc-cis133DA-in-v12). Once you are viewing the class organization, you should see all of the Repos that you have accepted assignment invitations for. It is recommended that you bookmark this page for future reference. Push (i.e., sync) the files on your computer with GitHub to ensure all files are uploaded to GitHub for your instructor to view.
4. Right-click the link to your repository and select **Copy Link Address**.
5. Go to the Assessing Your Learning page in your RioLearn lesson, and click the link to submit the assignment. Paste the link to your repo in the assignment submission box.
